# Basic Rules

[Back](../README.md)

## Characters

Make sure you understand your character sheets and the information on it. If you have any questions, do ask. I'm not going to remember everything about each of your characters, so I'll be asking you for bits and pieces. 

## Basics

As your DM, it's my job to make sure you understand what's going on and enjoy yourselves. Everytime you experience a a new aspect of the game for the first time I'll walk you through it. I'll also make suggestions about actions until you become more comfortable. 

## Table Rules

* You can tell everyone else as much or as little as you want
* You can ask questions out of character at any time
* You can talk about your character in the first or third person
* As DM, I don't know all the rules, but I will make the final judgement calls
* There's nothing you can do that your character can't try to do
* You don't have to role play, but if you don't I may decide what happens to you

Only people who are present in the scene can interact in that scene. Characters who aren't there technically don't know what happened unless they are told about it afterwards.
