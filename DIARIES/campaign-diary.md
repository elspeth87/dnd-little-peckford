# Campaign Diary

## 1516 DR - The Year of the Hangman's Joke

### Tarsakh - The Claw of the Storms

#### Day 25

*Little Peckford* 


The last Everything Market of the month.

* Sparkleduck - heading to market to buy strings for basket

* Nix "the weaver" - heading to sell baskets at the market

* Zealous - going to buy vegetables to make soup

Called on to help Lorilla (the Mayor) - her second cousin's daughter Feeb needs their help in Mossdeep. They agree to help. 

They all decide to go to the market for provisions.

* Nix - steals herbs from the herb witch

* Zealous - buys vegetables from the market and helps pregnant friend (Mercy) sell chickens

* Sparkleduck - visits friend Jason to buy a book, cuts self and steals book about Goblins

They have agreed to meet at the bridge at dawn. 


#### Day 26

*Bridge outside Little Peckford*

They set out at dawn, with Feebs in tow. Walking along the path along the river, they travel for a couple of hours towards the High Forest, the trees becoming thicker the further they go. 

Hearing a noise, they move towards it. Feeb stays behind (hiding in a bush). They realise it's a Worg! 

Battle ensues. Zealous and Nix do a lot of damage to the creature, but Sparkleduck's spell does more damage to them. Nix is knocked out, and shortly after, Zealous is also incapacitated by the worg, leaving Sparkleduck to deal the final blow. 

After some medical assistance (and having retrieved Feeb from the bush), they rest for the remainder of the day, and decide to wait for morning before continuing on their journey. 

Sparkleduck uses the time to read spells from her spell book. Nix goes foraging for herbs with which to make poison. Zealous knits a red scarf which she gifts to Feeb. 

#### Day 27

*Edge of the High Forest*

As soon as the sun was up they set out again, leaving behind the mangled carcass of the worg. They found their way back to the path and were soon making good time on the way to Mossdeep. 

Zealous spotted someone hiding behind a tree ahead of them, and went over to say hello. When the man and his friend tried to rob the party, they'd left them no choice. What followed was a speedy massacre. Both men lost their heads to a blade. 

After the dramatic encounter, Feeb told them of trouble that had been coming out of Hellgate Dell. 

They arrived in Mossdeep around lunchtime, to learn from Steeb (Feeb's dad) that Janacia (Feeb's mum) had gone missing.

The group agreed to investigate a nearby temple where she was last seen. There were axe marks on the door and they found two goblins inside the temple. The goblins were quickly destroyed - one of them burned alive by Zealous - and they investigated the temple. There were definite signs of a struggle, and drag marks heading towards the High Forest. Nix also found the beginnings of a carving of a star in one of the benches, which Zealous thought might have religious connotations, but being incomplete it would be hard to know for certain. 

They returned to Steeb's hut to spend the night and ate some questionable stew which Feeb had made for them (some handled it better than others). 

#### Day 28

*Steeb's hut, Mossdeep*

They avoided another round of stew and began to plan what they were going to do next. Feeb offered the group bowls of stew to take with them, which Nix and Zealous agreed to. 

They followed the tracks from the church into the High Forest. They soon found two goblins squabbling outside a large hole in the ground beneath a tree. 

Despite an attempt at stealth, they entered into battle with the goblins, killing them both quickly. 

Nix found a trap at the entrance to the cave which they all managed to jump over. Inside the cavern they found themselves attacked by three goblins and a warg which was tied to the wall. After a dramatic display of Zealous' fire breath, they killed the three goblins and paralysed the warg with one of Nix's poisoned arrows. 

Using her ability to talk to animals, and Nix's portion of stew, Sparkleduck talked the warg into seeing her as its master. Zealous investigated a whimpering at the back of the cave and found a crying, tied-up Janacia, worrying for her life. 

Nix discovered a skull, painted onto the wall of the cave, and a chest of goodies, some of which he shared with the others. 

They decided to rest for the night. 


#### Day 29

*Cave in the High Forest, near Mossdeep*

Early in the morning, Zealous' watch was interrupted by the sudden return of two more goblins. She killed one, and Sparkleduck killed the other. Nix slept through the whole thing. 

Janacia, impressed by Sparkleduck, gifted her a copper star wrapped in twine that she said would protect her. 

Sparkleduck freed her new friend, Worgatha (the worg), from the goblin's cave and the group helped Janacia return to Mossdeep. 

After a short rest at Steeb's house, the group said farewell to the family and headed back to Little Peckford, Zealous promising to deliver a box to Lorilla on Steeb's behalf. 

Along the path to Little Peckford they met a group of Mummers who had been travelling through the High Forest performing in temples. They performed a play about a dwarven princess for the group who were mostly very polite about it. They travelled back to Little Peckford together, getting to know some of the group better. 

When they were back in their home town, Zealous delivered the box to Lorilla, only to find it was filled with rather suspicious joints. The two of them spent the evening drinking Moonshine and getting high. 

Sparkleduck spent the evening trying to hide Worgatha, who knocked down her garden shed and refused to be hidden. 

Nix visited the Less Than Legal market and bought poison from a mysterious stranger in exchange for an ominous favour. 

#### Day 30

*Little Peckford*

The group spend the day resting and recovering from the previous days adventures. 

### Greengrass

*Little Peckford*

Each member of this merry band spent the day celebrating the Greengrass festival in their own way. Zealous and Nix were both in the town square when Lorilla threw moonshine at a group of small children trying to do a play about spring. 

That evening, Lorilla was abscent from the feast and every member of the town was keen to ruminate on why this might be. Zealous and Sparkleduck got drunk, while Nix managed to sneak away to sleep in his own shack. 

### Mirtul - The Melting

#### Day 1

*Little Peckford*

Nix found Sparkleduck and Zealous sleeping in the town square and woke them. He suggested they head to Lorilla's house to check in on her. 

When they arrived at Lorilla's house they find the door shut. A brief investigation leads them out the back door and to the nearby still. On the floor beneath one of the taps they find broken ceramic. In an attempt to properly investigate the still, Nix suggested they open all the taps, letting the moonshine spill across the floor and outside. Sparkleduck detected conjuration magic had been used in the area. 

Outside they hear a noise and find a scarecrow which they fight and successfully kill. After a brief investigation, which includes Zealous sliding down a moonshine soaked bank at the side of the river, they decide to head to the Shrine, to talk to Tim about any strange occurances in the area. 

Tim is very tightlipped, but suggests they go to Peckford if they are looking for information about wizards in the area. 

Because Zealous is feeling really dirty, she heads back to her castle for a bath and to procure some horses. Meanwhile Nix and Sparkleduck go to the market. They bump into Jason the bookseller, who has an argument with Sparkleduck that he misreads as sexually charged. She burps in his face, defusing the moment, while Nix steals a book on herbs. 

Later on that afternoon, they meet Zealous in the pub. She has brought two horses with her, called Twinkletoes and Crayola. They have a chat with Surrly, who tells them about Ryam heading to Peckford. They lie to her and tell her the mayor has gone to Mossdeep to visit some sick relatives. 

They leave to head for Peckford that evening. An hour or so into their journey, Sparkleduck feels a tingle of magic, and they are set upon by swarms of bats. They defeat the bats, but not before Sparkleduck is knocked unconcious. 

After healing Sparkleduck, the team decide to rest for the night. 

---

#### Day 2

*Road to Peckford*

Nix and Zealous' watches pass without incident, but Sparkleduck hears a noise a little way down the road. She meets a small halfling girl called Trynni Trickleback. After waking up the others, Trynni tells them she was travelling with her dad from the High Forest back to Peckford. She was staying in a farmstead outside the city and her father went missing. The gang decide to continue resting and then help Trynni find her father. 

A short while later, they find a path to the farmstead. The farmhands run scared at the sight of Worgatha. Nix transforms in to an elven lord and demands entry. A guy claiming to be Steve and a guy whose name is probably Steve show them the room where Travis Trickleback was staying. His chest is almost empty, with only underwear remaining. 

After a lot of arguing, they find out that Steve and Not Steve took the merchant's stuff and sold it at the Everything Market in Little Peckford. The gang investigates the farm and find a horse and an empty cart in the barn, and signs of the Greengrass festivities in an empty field between the barn and the farmhouse. In the field, Sparkleduck senses conjuration magic. Six deer appear from the barn. Sparkleduck talks to them and finds out that they're from a forest near the "Tower of the Moon". The team also finds out that a halfling called Simpson has also gone missing from the farm during Greengrass festival. 

They make Steve and Not Steve pay 5gp to reimburse the Trickleback's for what was stolen from them. They make their way to Peckford. While Sparkleduck deals with feeding Worgatha, Nix and Zealous return Trynni to her mother, Tristin, in the Artisan Quarter of the city, only to find out that the cart should have contained at least 8 rolls of silk, each worth in excess of 800gp. 

As the sun set on Peckford, Nix and Zealous made their way back to the town square and met up with Sparkleduck. Suddenly, Nix's eyes turned grey and his friends hurried to keep up as he strode around the market hall towards Cognition's Column. 

At the base of the column stood a cloaked figure, who demanded that Nix end the life of Lord Heward Ancelm. After asking at The Deep, they discovered that Lord Ancelm was a twelve year old, currently boarding at The Library. 

They made their way across Peckford, and Sparkleduck leads them through The Library to the dorms. The younger scholars were in the mess. Sparkleduck found the young lord torturing a rat at the dinner table. Sparkleduck used her magic hand to take the fork he was using to torture the rat and stab it into his thigh. A monk working in the Library rushed Lord Ancelm to his room, and the group followed him. 

They stormed the room, killing both the twelve year old boy and the monk. They framed the monk, crushing him under the chandelier, and waited for the dorms to fall asleep. 

After midnight, they snuck out (after throwing the corpse of the young boy out of the window). They delivered the corpse to Matilda and Maurice at Ze Shit'ole in exchange for one of the reams of silk that the Tricklebacks had lost and then spent the night at The Deep. In his pocket, Nix found The Twist of Fate. 

---

#### Day 3

*Peckford*

After spending the night at The Deep, Zealous, Sparkleduck and Nix - disguised as the High Elf Lord Pennyworth - head back to The Library in search of Parry. There, they encounter Miranda Featherfield, the receptionist. She is highly put out when Sparkleduck asks if she's reading porn and refuses to help them find Parry, but they find him anyway, in the reading library looking at fairytales. 

Parry tells them he's worried something strange is going on. He's concerned that his friend, Ryam, has not yet arrived and that they did not pass him on the road. He also tells them about seeing a halfling bartender turning into something that claimed to be a dwarf, but clearly was not one. It jogged a memory, so he decided to look for the book his mother read him as a child. He also talks about an inspiring elf he spoke to about planar travel, called Eryn who passed through Faires Rest on his way to Tyr's Point. 

The gang finds a book of fairytales by the Sisters Sinister called the tales of Far Far Away. Although there are no stories about dwarves in there, Parry is certain this is book one of the series his mum read to him. They find out that the Sisters Sinister were from Faires Rest and mysteriously went missing before they could publish any of their stories. 

In the stacks, they find a map of the Peckford Basin from the 11th Century, with 5 stars on it. They also find a book, written by Cognition, about the Peckford Basin at that time which mentions secret doors and keys. Sparkleduck checks out the books and the map. 

Zealous goes shopping for food and health potions, while Nix returns one of the ream of silk to Tristin, who is delighted to recieve it and asks eagerly when she'll recieve the rest. Sparkleduck heads over to her friend Isabella Bellhammer at the Moonshine Blues, a music shop in the Artisan Quarter of the city. As Nix arrives, they both learn that there was an elf in Peckford in the first tenday of Ches, talking about Mystra. 

After meeting Zealous at the Market Hall, the three of them head back to the Library to research Mystra. 

On their way back to The Deep for the night, Parry and a friend of his called Charles, caught up with the adventurers. Parry asked if they would protect them on their journey back to Faires Rest. Nix agreed, but told Parry that it would cost him 40gp. 

---

#### Day 4

*Peckford*

After a night's sleep at The Deep, they meet Parry and Charles by the Market Hall. Parry tries to pay Zealous the 20gp deposit for their trip, but she refuses and promises to help them out of the goodness of her heart. 

They travelled along the path to Faires Rest. As they stop for lunch, Sparkleduck wowed the whole team with a rendition of "Goblin Up A Drainpipe" on the dulcimer. 

After lunch, a tree stepped into their path. It started attacking them, but they killed it. Charles, Parry's short friend, recognised the tree and told them there were lots of talking trees in the Moonbay. 

That evening they arrive at Faires Rest, and accompany Parry as he leaves Charles with Kiko Zumo. Parry points them in the direction of The Fairies Rest as the only place in town to stay. After trying to negotiate a more reasonable price, they spend 5gp for 3 rooms for one night in the prestigious inn. 

---

#### Day 5

*Faires Rest*

After the best night's sleep they've ever had, the three meet outside the front of The Fairies Rest. Nix is now a red female Tiefling. 

They headed to the market where Nix spent all her pocketmoney on souvenirs. They also bought some food for the next 24 hours and made their way towards the Tourist Information Centre. 

At the Tourist Information Centre, they find information about tours of Faires Rest and tours specific to the Sisters Sinister. They take the two hour tour of Faires Rest, followed by paying for a visit to the home of the Sisters Sinister. 

Inside the cottage, they find (and Nix steals) a manuscript for the Sisters Sinister's unfinished story, *The Forever Tree*. After some investigation they see that two different people started to write the story, focusing on different things. 

While on the tour, Sparkleduck noticed a tree in the pine forest, which doesn't look like a pine. While they're investigating the area, a dwarf comes running at them with a long sword. They realise that it is Kiko. After a very terse conversation with the usually laid back dwarf, they find out that he is the guard of the gate to Far Far Away. Kiko agrees to show them the door if they take Charles back with them, and help solve whatever problem is going on in Far Far Away. 

Realising that they can't get through the door until the next full moon, which isn't until 14th Mirtul, they decide to spend the night at Kiko's house. 

---

#### Day 6

*Faires Rest*

After buying enough food for three days travel (including some delicious Dirty Cleric cheese), the gang heads out of Faires Rest towards Peckford. 

While on the road they come across two bears who attack them. In the ensuing conflict, Twinkletoes, Nix's trusty steed, was viciously killed. 

They spend the night in the fields outside Peckford. 

---

#### Day 7

*Peckford*

That morning, Nix - in the guise of a red tiefling called Catherine Btightwood - walked confidently into the town square in Peckford, and rode back out on a stolen warhorse which he named Sgt. Cloppers. 

Hightailing it out of Peckford, the gang make their way to Tyr's Point. A few miles outside of Peckford, Nix changes his appearance to look like a high elf called Lord Pennyworth. 

Passing over The Bridge, they get attacked by shrubbery and barely make it out alive. They rest for the night at The Bridge. 

---

#### Day 8

*The Bridge*

After a long night's sleep, the gang arrives at Tyr's Point. Tying up their mounts outside the town, they walk to the Docks. Nix steals a loaf of bread. 

In Tyr's Tower, they witness a sentancing being presided over by Justice Sacredbreeze. He sentances a half-elf to have his legs removed for stealing a horse. The half-elf claimed he didn't do it. 

Using some manipulation. they are invited into the judges ante-chamber, where they meet Justice Longview, Justuce Venra and Justice Shemmesh. Justice Longview tells them that Eryn was heading to The Old Manor the last time she saw him. 

After a delightfully awkward afternoon tea, the judges leave to watch the half-elf have his legs chopped off. 

Meanwhile the gang find a suspicious building in the Tyrran's Quarter and break into it. Inside they find cells one of which has a child inside. When they open one of the doors they are attacked by the bandits inside. During the struggle, both Nix and Zealous are knocked out cold.

Thoroughly beated, the unhappy group trudge across Tyr's Point to the campsite, agreeing to pay for a pitch and a tent for all of them, and some delicious smelling stew. When a Half-Elf male approaches and makes a pass at a somewhat squeamish Zealous, Nix turns into a male dragonborn and intimidates him, scaring him away. As they eat their stew, they talk to other people staying at the camp. They learn from the campsite owner that several halflings and a gnome have gone missing since the Greengrass festivities. 

---

#### Day 9

*Tyr's Point*

Deciding there is no more for them to learn in Tyr's Point, they head back to Peckford. 

However, on the road, the gang are attacked by a large yeti which seems extremely out of place in the lush green fields of the Peckford Basin. 

Rather than risking being caught in possesion of a stolen horse, they rest outside Peckford for the night. 

---

#### Day 10

*Peckford*

In a noble attempt to recoup the losses for the Trickleback's, the gang head back to the farm. There they find an old woman and a couple of farmhands who try to rob them. The team manage to overpower them and find some treasure in the farmhouse, but not enough to cover the Trickleback's expensive silks. 

They spend the night at the farm. 

---

#### Day 11

*Road to Peckford*

The team heads back to Peckford. Disguised as Lorn Pennyworth, Nix returns to Tristin Trickleback and gives her the bloodstones he found in the farm as well as the promise of the deed to the farm. 

Meanwhile, Sparkleduck and Zealous make their way to the market to top up supplies for both themselves and an extremely peckish Worgatha. Nix joins them and buys parchment. 

They spend the rest of the day shopping in Peckford, visiting such delights as Tom Hiddleston's Adventurers Shop (from which Nix steals a ring that he gives to Zealous and an amulet), and the Armorer (where they buy weaponery and order personalised shields, one with a Z and one with a sparkly penis). 

They then head to the mysterious location marked on Nix's map as Magenta's. There they find Magenta, a sturdy woman, trying to recruit people to join her cause against the gods. Something Nix says soon gets them kicked out. 

At Jason's book shop they try to buy the Rough Guide to Planar Travel and Artigas' Guide to Spotting Forgeries. Unfortunately, his prices are too high. In an attempt to save money, Sparkleduck tries to steal the book using her Unseen Servant. Her Unseen Servant not only tries to steal the wrong book, but is noticed by Jason who takes it back. 

By the time they arrive at the Library, it's closed. They decide to feed the horses and bed down for the night at The Deep. 

---

#### Day 12

*Peckford*

Being in a studious mood, the team starts their day with a trip to the Library. Here, Sparkleduck finds the book that Jason was trying to charge so much for, Nix fakes a deed for a farm using the parchment he bought the day before and Zealous becomes engrossed in a cook book called Mother Brothel's Summer Soups. 

Once they are done in the Library, Nix heads to Tristin's apartment, where he leaves the deed. Sparkleduck and Zealous go to pick up their shields, and by mid afternoon they are all on thier way to Faires Rest once more. 

Despite a short stop for dinner, Sparkleduck is soon exhausted, so the gang spend the night on the side of the road to Faires Rest. 

---

#### Day 13

*Road to Faires Rest*

The journey to Faires Rest is a long, but mostly uneventful one. By mid afternoon they arrive at Kiko's house where they rest up for the night. 

---

#### Day 14

*Faires Rest*

Zealous and Sparkleduck finally take the 8 hour tour of Faires Rest that they've been dreaming of. It's everything they hoped for and more. 

That evening when the moon is full, Kiko takes them to the tree which is not like the others. There he leaves them with Charles the dwarf who they had promised to return to his home in exchange for a wish if they reunite him with his brothers. They see five coloured stones on the floor. Each one picks up a different colour, only to find that they have been cursed. Only when they can figure out each of their afflictions are they able to cross through the portal which appears in the shape of a door in the tree...

---

---

## Far Far Away

#### Day 1

*Sisters Pass*

Arriving on the other side of the portal, they find themselves in bright daylight standing on a mountain path. A man approaches them. He tells them his name is Harvey Breton and he requests their help in rescuing his daughter from a foul "bête" which has ensnared her. 

They follow Harvey to a large castle surrounded by overgrown foliage. Inside the courtyard they find a young lady crying over the body of a dying beast. Although they try to help her save him, despite Harvey's insistance to the contrary, it is not until a single tear falls from the young lady onto the beast's cheek that he awakens. 

Grateful to the team for trying to save him, he rewards them with treasures from his castle. 

As they continue down the mountain path they are attacked by a group of knights who knock out Zealous, Nix and Sparkleduck and tie them up. 

The next four days are spent in the back of their cart, being treated like criminals. They do not see Charles. 

---

#### Day 5

*Silvervayne*

Upon their arrival at Silvervayne, they are lead through the pristine town to castle of the Fairy King. The castle is made up of many multicoloured towers of different heights and sizes. Inside they are presented to the Queen, who they recoginse as Bodwynn Icehelm, the Dwarven Princess from the Sisters Sinister's story. She is kind to them until her husband, the fairy king arrives, along with their somewhat petulant daughter, Princess Darilynn. 

At dinner, the Fairy King informs them that he has had enough trouble from other strangers turning up in his kingdom and trying to take his throne. If they want to live, they will bring him a symbol of obesience from each of the four most powerful families in Far Far Away. 

From Bea Clifton in Port Crimson, he requires "the root of her secret"; from Thorstar Lodmundsson in Castingveil, the "wings of love"; from Sultana Scherezade in Vistaspire, "her voice"; and from Peleus in Moonport, he demands "Demios". 

They spend their night in the palace. 

---

#### Day 6

*Silvervayne*

Before leaving that morning, Sparkleduck is taken to one side by the Queen and given a wand to help with their mission. 

They leave on the great ship, The Providence, with a team of 11 to help them, including Captain Jaydan, one of the knights who captured them. Nell, the first mate, is much more friendly and shows them around the ship. 

They sail south along the coastline, heading to their first destination; Moonport.

Over dinner, they hear from the cook, Erhart, the story of seven brothers from his home town of Septaglade. 

----

#### Day 7

*The Providence*

During the night, the adventurers hear chaos errupting on the main deck, and leave their shared cabin to find the boat being attached by merpeople riding giant seahorses. 

In helping to defend the ship, they befriend some of the crew. 

During the day, they explore the boat. Nix investigates Erika, and steals a knotted ribbon and some herbs from a chest by her bunk. Zealous makes friends with Trude, the healer on the ship, who tells her about a ghostship in her hometown. Sparkleduck meets Ben, a nice but dim junior member of the crew who tells her about his hometown of Easterportal, which they are currently sailing past. 

Erhart bakes sweet buns for dinner, a traditional treat from Easterportal. 

---

#### Day 8

*The Providence*

The Providence is attacked by a killer whale. The team jumps into action, but Nell is wounded during the encounter. 

With a lot of delicious meat now onboard the ship thanks to the dead killer whale, the team helps the rest of the crew butcher and store the meat. Noticing Erika crying, they discover that her ribbon is missing. It is a fidelity ribbon, coated in the seed of her husband, designed to ensure that he is faithful to her while she is away. They ask Erika about how she feels about the Fairy King. 

They also meet Dagmar and speak to Lukas, before sitting down to a dinner of killer whale. 

That evening, while Ben and Helmut are on the main deck, Nix, in the guise of the Fairy King, sneaks downstairs to Erika's hammock to return the fidelity ribbon. When he whispers her name into her ear she awakes with a scream, and continues to scream when she sees the man she thinks is the Fairy King standing over her bed. The rest of the crew awakes, and the "Fairy King" sends them all up to the deck. He returns the ribbon to Erika and tells her to help Nix, Zealous and Sparkleduck however she can. She eagerly agrees. 

Walking up to the main deck, the "Fairy King" tells the crew that this was a test. They have passed for now. He then turns into a raven and flies away. Zealous and Sparkleduck, not realising that the Fairy King is Nix, try to find their friend. Realising that Nix is missing, Erika is distraught, worried that she is already failing the instructions given to her by the Fairy King. She stops the ship, insisting the weigh anchor so that they can find Nix, dead or alive. 

Meanwhile, Nix flies back to the window if his cabin. He is helped inside by Sparkleduck and Zealous. The douse him in water which they lift into the cabin using a chamber pot, so that they can claim they pulled him out of the water. 

---

#### Day 9

*The Providence* 

Erika is relieved to see Nix and believes that he fell in the sea. They up anchor and continue on their way. 

---

#### Day 10

*The Providence* 

They are awoken by Nell who drags them to the main deck, where people "attracted to women" are tying themsleves to the sides of the boat. Nix and Nell are tied up, and then they hear the singing. Nix, and the other people tied to the side of the boat, immediately start to try to break their bounds to reach the two sirens who are singing to them. 

After a long and drawn out battle, during which Nix slips his bounds, turns into a raven, flies to the sirens and is then paralysed, the sirens are killed. The Providence continues on to Moonport. 

Once in Moonport, they make their way to the Palace of Perimedes, home of Peleus, using fake names. They are lead to a waiting room where they hear two women bickering about who slept with whose husband first. From these two ladies they learn that Peleus is training his son to be as strong a hero as Heracles. 

When Sparkleduck corrects them to Hercules, they get angry, believing that these strangers are friends of Jupiter who keeps insisting that the gods have different names. 

Finally, a guard leads them through to see King Peleus. He greets them in his throne room and is surprised and delighted that they have travelled so far to see his son, believing they are his fans. He takes them to the gymnasium to see Galtran, Demios' trainer who informs them that he hasn't seen the lad in about 5 days. 

Galtran leads them to the Maze of Artemis, a place an hour or so walk from Moonport which he uses to scare straight some of his more stubborn students. They take the stone spiral staircase down into the entry hall, where they find footprints they believe belong to Demios. 

However, before they are able to enter the maze, they are set upon by three birds.
