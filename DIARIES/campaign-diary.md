## 1516 DR - The Year of the Hangman's Joke

### Tarsakh - The Claw of the Storms

#### Day 25

*Little Peckford* 


The last Everything Market of the month.

* Sparkleduck - heading to market to buy strings for basket

* Nix "the weaver" - heading to sell baskets at the market

* Zealous - going to buy vegetables to make soup

Called on to help Lorilla (the Mayor) - her second cousin's daughter Feeb needs their help in Mossdeep. They agree to help. 

They all decide to go to the market for provisions.

* Nix - steals herbs from the herb witch

* Zealous - buys vegetables from the market and helps pregnant friend (Mercy) sell chickens

* Sparkleduck - visits friend Jason to buy a book, cuts self and steals book about Goblins

They have agreed to meet at the bridge at dawn. 


#### Day 26

*Bridge outside Little Peckford*

They set out at dawn, with Feebs in tow. Walking along the path along the river, they travel for a couple of hours towards the High Forest, the trees becoming thicker the further they go. 

Hearing a noise, they move towards it. Feeb stays behind (hiding in a bush). They realise it's a Worg! 

Battle ensues. Zealous and Nix do a lot of damage to the creature, but Sparkleduck's spell does more damage to them. Nix is knocked out, and shortly after, Zealous is also incapacitated by the worg, leaving Sparkleduck to deal the final blow. 

After some medical assistance (and having retrieved Feeb from the bush), they rest for the remainder of the day, and decide to wait for morning before continuing on their journey. 

Sparkleduck uses the time to read spells from her spell book. Nix goes foraging for herbs with which to make poison. Zealous knits a red scarf which she gifts to Feeb. 

#### Day 27

*Edge of the High Forest*

As soon as the sun was up they set out again, leaving behind the mangled carcass of the worg. They found their way back to the path and were soon making good time on the way to Mossdeep. 

Zealous spotted someone hiding behind a tree ahead of them, and went over to say hello. When the man and his friend tried to rob the party, they'd left them no choice. What followed was a speedy massacre. Both men lost their heads to a blade. 

After the dramatic encounter, Feeb told them of trouble that had been coming out of Hellgate Dell. 

They arrived in Mossdeep around lunchtime, to learn from Steeb (Feeb's dad) that Janacia (Feeb's mum) had gone missing.

The group agreed to investigate a nearby temple where she was last seen. There were axe marks on the door and they found two goblins inside the temple. The goblins were quickly destroyed - one of them burned alive by Zealous - and they investigated the temple. There were definite signs of a struggle, and drag marks heading towards the High Forest. Nix also found the beginnings of a carving of a star in one of the benches, which Zealous thought might have religious connotations, but being incomplete it would be hard to know for certain. 

They returned to Steeb's hut to spend the night and ate some questionable stew which Feeb had made for them (some handled it better than others). 

#### Day 28

*Steeb's hut, Mossdeep*

They avoided another round of stew and began to plan what they were going to do next. Feeb offered the group bowls of stew to take with them, which Nix and Zealous agreed to. 

They followed the tracks from the church into the High Forest. They soon found two goblins squabbling outside a large hole in the ground beneath a tree. 

Despite an attempt at stealth, they entered into battle with the goblins, killing them both quickly. 

Nix found a trap at the entrance to the cave which they all managed to jump over. Inside the cavern they found themselves attacked by three goblins and a warg which was tied to the wall. After a dramatic display of Zealous' fire breath, they killed the three goblins and paralysed the warg with one of Nix's poisoned arrows. 

Using her ability to talk to animals, and Nix's portion of stew, Sparkleduck talked the warg into seeing her as its master. Zealous investigated a whimpering at the back of the cave and found a crying, tied-up Janacia, worrying for her life. 

Nix discovered a skull, painted onto the wall of the cave, and a chest of goodies, some of which he shared with the others. 

They decided to rest for the night. 


#### Day 29

*Cave in the High Forest, near Mossdeep*

Early in the morning, Zealous' watch was interrupted by the sudden return of two more goblins. She killed one, and Sparkleduck killed the other. Nix slept through the whole thing. 

Janacia, impressed by Sparkleduck, gifted her a copper star wrapped in twine that she said would protect her. 

Sparkleduck freed her new friend, Worgatha (the worg), from the goblin's cave and the group helped Janacia return to Mossdeep. 

After a short rest at Steeb's house, the group said farewell to the family and headed back to Little Peckford, Zealous promising to deliver a box to Lorilla on Steeb's behalf. 

Along the path to Little Peckford they met a group of Mummers who had been travelling through the High Forest performing in temples. They performed a play about a dwarven princess for the group who were mostly very polite about it. They travelled back to Little Peckford together, getting to know some of the group better. 

When they were back in their home town, Zealous delivered the box to Lorilla, only to find it was filled with rather suspicious joints. The two of them spent the evening drinking Moonshine and getting high. 

Sparkleduck spent the evening trying to hide Worgatha, who knocked down her garden shed and refused to be hidden. 

Nix visited the Less Than Legal market and bought poison from a mysterious stranger in exchange for an ominous favour. 

#### Day 30

*Little Peckford*

The group spend the day resting and recovering from the previous days adventures. 

### Greengrass

*Little Peckford*

Each member of this merry band spent the day celebrating the Greengrass festival in their own way. Zealous and Nix were both in the town square when Lorilla threw moonshine at a group of small children trying to do a play about spring. 

That evening, Lorilla was abscent from the feast and every member of the town was keen to ruminate on why this might be. Zealous and Sparkleduck got drunk, while Nix managed to sneak away to sleep in his own shack. 

### Mirtul - The Melting

#### Day 1

*Little Peckford*

Nix found Sparkleduck and Zealous sleeping in the town square and woke them. He suggested they head to Lorilla's house to check in on her. 

When they arrived at Lorilla's house they find the door shut. A brief investigation leads them out the back door and to the nearby still. On the floor beneath one of the taps they find broken ceramic. In an attempt to properly investigate the still, Nix suggested they open all the taps, letting the moonshine spill across the floor and outside. Sparkleduck detected conjuration magic had been used in the area. 

Outside they hear a noise and find a scarecrow which they fight and successfully kill. After a brief investigation, which includes Zealous sliding down a moonshine soaked bank at the side of the river, they decide to head to the Shrine, to talk to Tim about any strange occurances in the area. 

Tim is very tightlipped, but suggests they go to Peckford if they are looking for information about wizards in the area. 

Because Zealous is feeling really dirty, she heads back to her castle for a bath and to procure some horses. Meanwhile Nix and Sparkleduck go to the market. They bump into Jason the bookseller, who has an argument with Sparkleduck that he misreads as sexually charged. She burps in his face, defusing the moment, while Nix steals a book on herbs. 

Later on that afternoon, they meet Zealous in the pub. She has brought two horses with her, called Twinkletoes and Crayola. They have a chat with Surrly, who tells them about Ryam heading to Peckford. They lie to her and tell her the mayor has gone to Mossdeep to visit some sick relatives. 

They leave to head for Peckford that evening. An hour or so into their journey, Sparkleduck feels a tingle of magic, and they are set upon by swarms of bats. They defeat the bats, but not before Sparkleduck is knocked unconcious. 

After healing Sparkleduck, the team decide to rest for the night.

#### Day 2

*Road to Peckford*

Nix and Zealous' watches pass without incident, but Sparkleduck hears a noise a little way down the road. She meets a small halfling girl called Trynni Trickleback. After waking up the others, Trynni tells them she was travelling with her dad from the High Forest back to Peckford. She was staying in a farmstead outside the city and her father went missing. The gang decide to continue resting and then help Trynni find her father. 

A short while later, they find a path to the farmstead. The farmhands run scared at the sight of Worgatha. Nix transforms in to an elven lord and demands entry. A guy claiming to be Steve and a guy whose name is probably Steve show them the room where Travis Trickleback was staying. His chest is almost empty, with only underwear remaining. 

After a lot of arguing, they find out that Steve and Not Steve took the merchant's stuff and sold it at the Everything Market in Little Peckford. The gang investigates the farm and find a horse and an empty cart in the barn, and signs of the Greengrass festivities in an empty field between the barn and the farmhouse. In the field, Sparkleduck senses conjuration magic. Six deer appear from the barn. Sparkleduck talks to them and finds out that they're from a forest near the "Tower of the Moon". The team also finds out that a halfling called Simpson has also gone missing from the farm during Greengrass festival. 

They make Steve and Not Steve pay 5gp to reimburse the Trickleback's for what was stolen from them. They make their way to Peckford. While Sparkleduck deals with feeding Worgatha, Nix and Zealous return Trynni to her mother, Tristin, in the Artisan Quarter of the city, only to find out that the cart should have contained at least 8 rolls of silk, each worth in excess of 800gp. 

As the sun set on Peckford, Nix and Zealous made their way back to the town square and met up with Sparkleduck. Suddenly, Nix's eyes turned grey and his friends hurried to keep up as he strode around the market hall towards Cognition's Column. 

At the base of the column stood a cloaked figure, who demanded that Nix end the life of Lord Heward Ancelm. After asking at The Deep, they discovered that Lord Ancelm was a twelve year old, currently boarding at The Library. 

They made their way across Peckford, and Sparkleduck leads them through The Library to the dorms. The younger scholars were in the mess. Sparkleduck found the young lord torturing a rat at the dinner table. Sparkleduck used her magic hand to take the fork he was using to torture the rat and stab it into his thigh. A monk working in the Library rushed Lord Ancelm to his room, and the group followed him. 

They stormed the room, killing both the twelve year old boy and the monk. They framed the monk, crushing him under the chandelier, and waited for the dorms to fall asleep. 

After midnight, they snuck out (after throwing the corpse of the young boy out of the window). They delivered the corpse to Matilda and Maurice at Ze Shit'ole and then spent the night at The Deep. In his pocket, Nix found The Twist of Fate.
