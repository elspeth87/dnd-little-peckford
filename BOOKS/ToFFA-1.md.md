## The Dwarven Princess

The Dwarven Princess fell in love with a human merchant from the High Forest. She was on her way to marry him when she was stolen by fairies when resting in the forest. 

When she didn't arrive, her lover, was sick with worry. He believed that her father had changed his mind and was holding her against her will. He called on his friends from Sundabarr, selling everything he owned to pay for as many men as he could to help him rescue the princess. 

Meanwhile, the princess was being held in the fairy kingdom by a Fairy King. He was enamoured of her, and - not understanding emotions of those from another realm - was determined to keep her whether she wanted to be kept or not. To do so, he threatened the lives of those she loved most. 

Worrying for the lives of the merchant and her family, the dwarven princess agreed to marry the Fairy King. As a wedding gift, she was presented with a mirror that allowed her to watch the world on the other side of the veil. As soon as she was alone she asked to see the merchant, hoping to at least be able to watch him find his own happiness, even if she could not be part of it. Instead, she was confronted with the terrifying vision of her lover on his way to confront her father. 

After much begging and pleading, the Fairy King agreed to transport her back to the other side one last time. 

Together, they intercepted the merchant at the frozen lake. The Fairy King toyed with the merchant, showing off his new wife. Unable to bear the distraught look on her lover's face, the dwarven princess stepped forward. First, she addressed the men with the merchant, promising they would be paid for their efforts. Then she addressed the dwarves who had come out of the mines to watch, imploring them to tell her father and family that she was well and happy, that the Fairy King would keep her safe. Finally she turned to the merchant, telling him that he would always have her heart. Reaching inside her robes, she threw a small piece of glass towards him. 

Furious at the actions of his wife, the Fairy King watched as the merchant rushed forward to grab the gift that had been thrown towards him. When he reached it, the Fairy King clicked his fingers, causing the ice to break and the merchant to fall through. The Dwarven Princess screamed in horror and in the next second both she and the Fairy King vanished. 

The merchant was pulled out of the water by his friends, clasping the piece of glass in his hand. It was part of the mirror his lover had been given. Although they may not meet again, it would not be the last time they saw each other. 


## Troll Wall

A girl was on her way to visit her aunt. It was late at night when she came across a troll sitting on a mossy stone wall. He told her he was waiting to see the moon. 

When she asked why, he explained that when the moon came out he would be able to join his family. He asked if the little girl would like to meet his family, that they would like her. 

Not wanting to be rude, she agreed. 

When the moon hit the moss-covered stone, the entire wall turned into trolls, who all promptly ate the girl. 


## The Well

The story of the well tells of a young boy who was playing too close to a well. The well was dry and he'd been told by his mother not to play near it. All the other children were too scared to play near it, but he wasn't scared like them. 

So, when he heard a voice calling to him from inside the well, asking him to come to the well and play. Deciding he liked the sound of the voice, he ignored his mother's words and went closer to the well. Looking down, he was surprised to see water in the well. 

What he couldn't see was the person he was talking to. Keen to meet his new friend, he kept leaning forward until he fell in. 

The voice started laughing. The water was up to the little boy's knees. It was cold and salty. But the young boy was happy to be with his new friend, until the laughter faded away. 

When the mother realised her boy was missing, she went looking. She checked inside the well, but all she could see was the dry bottom. 

The little boy looked up, crying and crying, his tears adding water around him. He watched as his mother tried to find him, but gave up, thinking he'd run off into the forest, not realising he was right beneath her nose. 


## Forever Tree

This is the famous lost story of the Sisters Sinister. No one knows exactly what this story was about. The story was started but never finished. It was found in their cottage after the Sisters Sinister disappeared. Only one sentence was found.
