# A Rough Guide To Planar Travel

## Introduction

The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the Planes of Existence. 

Although many doubt the existance of other planes, there are many of us who know from experience that they are there, and when tapped into, are the key to understanding our own plane. 

Beyond those realms that are exist within the material planes are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of Demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.

Beyond the Material Plane, the various Planes of Existence are realms of myth and Mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.


## Travel

When adventurers travel into other Planes of Existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. 

Travel to other planes can be accomplished in two ways: by Casting a Spell or by using a planar portal.

A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some Portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-- shrouded Passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar Travel. Others are locations— circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining one plane with a very similar location on another.

## The Peckford Basin

There are many rumours of entry points to demiplanes in the Peckford Basin. 

Unlike other planes, demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given Demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane.

Although the exact number of entry points to these demiplanes is not known, it is widely understood within the community of plane travelers that those points are well guarded. Stories tell of a High Elf who took it upon themselves to "tidy up" the Basin, before locking the entry points behind a door which was guarded by both a test of brains and a test of brawn. The doors themselves are said to be locked in to the passing of time, only becoming visible at certain times of day or on specific days.
